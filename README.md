# Angular Simple

My goal here was to create the most simple version of Angular possible 
for the purpose of teaching how each of the pieces work.

## To Run This

1. `git clone git@github.com:jeffwhelpley/angular-simple.git`
1. `cd angular-simple`
1. `npm i`
1. `npm run build`
1. `npm start`
1. For the AngularJS 1.x example go to [http://localhost:9999/ng1.html](http://localhost:9999/ng1.html)
1. For the Angular 2+ example go to [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999)
